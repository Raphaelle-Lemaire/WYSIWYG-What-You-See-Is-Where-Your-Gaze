# WYSIWYG: What You See Is Where Your Gaze
This repository contains the source code used for the paper published at the Interactive Digital Art track at ACMMM 2025.

The Jupyter Notebook provided includes all the code necessary to reproduce the images from the [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/o_7fUSNWxgM). Additionally, you will find a selection of videos and images generated from our work.

The code for the original model and the images required to use it are available at the [ACMM_code repository from AzamatKaibaldiyev](https://github.com/AzamatKaibaldiyev/ACMM_code).
